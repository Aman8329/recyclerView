RecyclerView is a ViewGroup added to the android studio as a successor of the GridView and ListView. 
It is an improvement on both of them and can be found in the latest v-7 support packages. 
It has been created to make possible construction of any lists with XML layouts as an item which can be customized vastly while improving on the efficiency of ListViews and GridViews.
